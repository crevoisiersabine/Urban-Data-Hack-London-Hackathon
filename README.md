Hackathon on connected cities. Several organisations provided a number of datasets to be explored over the weekend to see what cool stuff could be created. I teamed up with another 6 people and worked on cashless transactions for parking data to see if we could predict parking spaces in London and then visualise on a map and create an app that could be useful for people. In my github I present the data manipulation code and some of the prediction models done with R.
